  <h1>Statistics</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
      <p>There have been at least 633 people tweeting on the hashtag. Currently I've indexed 2048 maps by 308 people.</p>
      <h3>Progress</h3>
      <p>
        The main reason this sort of thing hasn't been done by dozens of
        other people already is that the tweets are a vast unstructured
        data set. Even the seemingly 'simple' task of assigning each map
        to one of the 30 days is manually time consuming - a lot of people
        didn't explicitly label the theme, or they got the number wrong,
        and even if they did there wasn't a consistent format. For something
        like topics or map types without a clear classification scheme it's
        even more time consuming. So be aware with all these stats that
        they're necessarily incomplete for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've managed to get through over half the tweets and assign
        them a challenge day. I've focussed on the easily identifiable
        ones, so hopefully (timewise) a good proportion of the remainder are
        just discussion rather than new maps.
        Of those I have indexed, the majority initially only had a day
        assigned (in the interest of time). Currently,
        89.7% don't have
        an area assigned (ie continent or country),
        97.8% don't have
        a city assigned (though many don't need one),
        93.2% don't have any tools assigned,
        94.6% don't have the type of map assigned, and
        96% don't have topics assigned.
      </p>
      <h3>Daily Themes</h3>

      <h3>People</h3>
      <p>Currently I have 4 people recorded as completing all 30 maps - @citizenfishy, @CRVanPollard, @hrbrmstr, @jerry_shannon - but that will increase.</p>
